👋🏾 Hey, I'm

# Ciarán

I'm a software engineer from Cape Town 🇿🇦 and I spend a lot of time thinking about the web, online privacy, Linux and art of all kinds.

I've spent recent years working as a full-stack (often solo) developer for corporate, e-commerce and portfolio websites, a large debt-collection app and various side projects of my own. I also [make music](https://soundcloud.com/parabyl).
